        It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isnâ€™t much easier now that he is an overworked
        employee of the Ministry of Magic,a husband and father of three school-age children. While Harry grapples
        with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngestson Albus must struggle with the weight
        of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the
        uncomfortable truth: sometimes,darkness comes from unexpected places.</p>

      and the last four Harry Potter books have consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history.<br><br>
      The Harry Potter books have also gained recognition for sparking an interest in reading among the young at a time when
      children were thought to be abandoning books for computers and television, although it is reported that despite
      the huge uptake of the books, adolescent reading has continued to decline.</p>
